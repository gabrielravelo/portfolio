      My name is Gabriel. My journey began with a curiosity for how data moves across the web, which evolved into a specialization in <strong>Backend Architecture</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      While I have a strong background in Full-stack development, today I focus on the "heavy lifting": designing scalable databases with <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, orchestrating containers with <strong>Docker</strong>, and building type-safe APIs with <strong>NestJS</strong>. My goal is simple: to build systems that are not only functional but also maintainable and efficient.
